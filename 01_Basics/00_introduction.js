// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. 
// This means that variable types are determined at runtime, 
// and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. 
// You can assign different types of values to a variable during its lifetime.

// For example, in JavaScript, you can do the following:
// let x = 10; // x is now a number
// x = "Hello"; // x is now a string
// x = true; // x is now a boolean

// On the other hand, 
// statically typed languages require you to declare the variable's type explicitly, 
// and the type checking is done at compile-time, before the code is executed.

// Languages like Java, C++, and TypeScript are statically typed, 
// and they require you to specify the variable type explicitly when declaring them:

// int x = 10; // x is a variable of type int
// String name = "John"; // name is a variable of type String
// JavaScript's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility but can lead to potential runtime errors if not handled carefully. 
// Static typing, on the other hand, provides better type safety at the cost of some initial verbosity and strictness.
